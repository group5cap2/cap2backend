You’ll need to be; this thriller will test your brain with its reverse chronological structure, and it’s a page-turner to boot.” —<i>Elle</i><br /><br /> Like the spellbinding psychological suspense in <i>The Girl on the Train </i>and <i>Luckiest Girl Alive</i>, Megan Miranda’s novel is a nail-biting, breathtaking story about the disappearances of two young women—a decade apart—told in reverse.</b><br /><br />It’s been ten years since Nicolette Farrell left her rural hometown after her best friend, Corinne, disappeared from Cooley Ridge without a trace. Back again to tie up loose ends and care for her ailing father, Nic is soon plunged into a shocking drama that reawakens Corinne’s case and breaks open old wounds long since stitched.<br /><br /> The decade-old investigation focused on Nic, her brother Daniel, boyfriend Tyler, and Corinne’s boyfriend Jackson. Since then, only Nic has left Cooley Ridge. Daniel and his wife, Laura, are expecting a baby; Jackson works at the town bar; and Tyler is dating Annaleise Carter, Nic’s younger neighbor and the group’s alibi the night Corinne disappeared. Then, within days of Nic’s return, Annaleise goes missing.<br /><br /> Told backwards—Day 15 to Day 1—from the time Annaleise goes missing, Nic works to unravel the truth about her younger neighbor’s disappearance, revealing shocking truths about her friends, her family, and what <i>really </i>happened to Corinne that night ten years ago.<br /><br /> Like nothing you’ve ever read before, <i>All the Missing Girls</i> delivers in all the right ways. With twists and turns that lead down dark alleys and dead ends, you may think you’re walking a familiar path, but then Megan Miranda turns it all upside down and inside out and leaves us wondering just how far we would be willing to go to protect those we love."}],[{"wrapperType":"audiobook","artistId":82070491,"collectionId":1418674275,"artistName":"Annie Duke","collectionName":"Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts (Unabridged)","collectionCensoredName":"Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts (Unabridged)","artistViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/author/annie-duke/id82070491?uo=4","collectionViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/audiobook/thinking-in-bets-making-smarter-decisions-when-you/id1418674275?uo=4","artworkUrl60":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music114/v4/eb/c1/2e/ebc12ea5-eb24-1c51-78d6-0f2dfd704500/9780525532545.d.jpg/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music114/v4/eb/c1/2e/ebc12ea5-eb24-1c51-78d6-0f2dfd704500/9780525532545.d.jpg/100x100bb.jpg","collectionPrice":12.99,"collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackCount":1,"country":"USA","currency":"USD","releaseDate":"2018-02-06T08:00:00Z","primaryGenreName":"Business & Personal Finance","previewUrl":"https://audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/AudioPreview115/v4/8c/50/d5/8c50d5a3-cef4-5c77-a366-720f33ff71df/mzaf_2582988837300413464.std.aac.p.m4a","description":"<b><i>Wall Street Journal </i>bestseller! <br /><br />Poker champion turned business consultant Annie Duke teaches you how to get comfortable with uncertainty and make better decisions as a result.</b><br /><br />In Super Bowl XLIX, Seahawks coach Pete Carroll made one of the most controversial calls in football history: With 26 seconds remaining, and trailing by four at the Patriots' one-yard line, he called for a pass instead of a hand off to his star running back. The pass was intercepted and the Seahawks lost. Critics called it the dumbest play in history. But was the call really that bad? Or did Carroll actually make a great move that was ruined by bad luck?<br /><br />Even the best decision doesn't yield the best outcome every time. There's always an element of luck that you can't control, and there is always information that is hidden from view. So the key to long-term success (and avoiding worrying yourself to death) is to think in bets: How sure am I? What are the possible ways things could turn out? What decision has the highest odds of success? Did I land in the unlucky 10% on the strategy that works 90% of the time? Or is my success attributable to dumb luck rather than great decision making? <br /><br />Annie Duke, a former World Series of Poker champion turned business consultant, draws on examples from business, sports, politics, and (of course) poker to share tools anyone can use to embrace uncertainty and make better decisions. For most people, it's difficult to say \"I'm not sure\" in a world that values and, even, rewards the appearance of certainty. But professional poker players are comfortable with the fact that great decisions don't always lead to great outcomes and bad decisions don't always lead to bad outcomes.<br /><br />By shifting your thinking from a need for certainty to a goal of accurately assessing what you know and what you don't, you'll be less vulnerable to reactive emotions, knee-jerk biases, and destructive habits in your decision making. You'll become more confident, calm, compassionate and successful in the long run."}]]},{"username":"sara","email":"sara@dff.com","passward":"1111","favorite":[]}]
